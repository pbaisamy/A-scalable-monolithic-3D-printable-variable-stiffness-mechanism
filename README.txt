The files given in this folder contain the 3D modeling files of the C-MAC, 
a 3D printable variable stiffness mechanism. The full details regarding this 
system are presented in the paper 'A scalable monolithic 3D printable 
variable stiffness mechanism' by Paul Baisamy, Adam Stokes and Francesco 
Giorgio-Serchi presented at ICRA 2024. A Solidworks file containing the six 
configurations tested in the paper and one step file for the configuration 3 
(wire diameter = 4mm, spring mean diameter = 17.5mm)are given.
